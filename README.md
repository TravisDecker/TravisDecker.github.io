**Hi, I'm Travis Decker. I am a software developer, photographer and explorer. I recently graduated from Deep Dive Coding; a full time intensive boot camp where I learned Java, Android, Git/Version control and a ton more. I am very excited about my new skills and I am eager to find employment... wink wink, nudge nudge. 
Below you will find some information about my different software projects as well as my photography. At the bottom of the page, there are links to my social media accounts to stay up to date, as well as other links to sites or entities I may reference throughout this page.**

## Other News
I recently experienced one of the coolest interviews ever. Bootime, a local company here in Albuquerque, Does what they call an “Applicant Party”. They Invite all job applicants as well as all of their employees and its a way for every to sorta of experience the environment. They pre plan activities and it was a lot of fun. It's a cultural interveiew and very effective in my opinion.
